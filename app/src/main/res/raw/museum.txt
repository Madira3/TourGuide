The Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center is the companion facility of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum, located near Dulles Airport. Its two huge hangars — the Boeing Aviation Hangar and the James S. McDonnell Space Hangar — display thousands of aviation and space artifacts, including a Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird, a Concorde, and the Space Shuttle Discovery. Guests can also view the Mary Baker Engen Restoration Hangar from a glassed-in mezzanine.

The museum offers free docent tours daily. The facility also offers special features, including a soaring observation tower from which visitors can watch air traffic at Dulles, flight simulators, and an Imax theater. The Udvar-Hazy Center has a museum store and food service. Education and family activities are also offered, and events are held throughout the year.
