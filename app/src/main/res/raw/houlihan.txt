Join us at Houlihan’s Restaurant + Bar for a made-from-scratch meal in a trendy environment. From fresh-baked artisan breads to amazing mini desserts, you’ll find a variety of popular dishes along with interesting new tastes delivered to the table with smart presentations at incredible value. Our scratch cooking is what truly separates us from the pack. While most casual restaurants use microwaves and pre-assembled or pre-cooked ingredients, everything on our menu is made the hard way - from scratch. From appetizers and salads to entrées and desserts, it's all prepared here daily. With love. The Nooner. Nooner menu available Monday through Friday from 11am to 2pm for parties of six or fewer.
