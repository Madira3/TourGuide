Stone's Cove is a KitBar. A KitBar? Think about the parties you have had at your home. Most of them probably ended up in your kitchen. Or, think about the fun and comfort of your favorite neighborhood place. Now, combine these two and you have Stone's Cove KitBar, a wonderful place to eat well, laugh often, refresh and recharge.

Here at Stone's Cove, we like to sample, share and graze, enjoying different foods to meet our moods. Come solo or bring a crowd and grab some plates to share while enjoying our highly-rated wine list and hand-crafted original cocktails. Either way, you'll be with friends.
