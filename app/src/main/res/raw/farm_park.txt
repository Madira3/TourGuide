Frying Pan Park preserves a reminder of Fairfax County's rural heritage from 1920 to 1940 at Kidwell Farm. Visitors can see or pet draft horses, pigs, goats, cows, sheep, rabbits, chickens and peacocks.

The four-room schoolhouse built in 1911 is a hub of arts and crafts, fitness, children's classes and summer camp programs. The Moffett Blacksmith Shop contains the smithy's original equipment. The Country Store housed a shop and classroom for vocational agriculture from 1919 to about 1930. The Frying Pan Spring Meeting House was built in 1791 and is designated a "Virginia Landmark."
