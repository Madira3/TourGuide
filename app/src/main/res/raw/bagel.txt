The Bagel Cafe is an authentic "NY-Style" Bagel Shop/Delicatessen located in the rapidly expanding Dulles Corridor of Herndon Virginia.

All our Bagels, Cream Cheese Spreads, Soups, Sandwiches, Salads, and Desserts, (like our oversized Black and White Cookies),  are made fresh, from scratch on premises. When it comes to food, we make no compromises.  We pride ourselves on our food's freshness, quality, taste and value.
